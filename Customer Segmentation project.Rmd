### Introduction section
This report details the analysis of a customer dataset to segment customers based on their order and search behavior. Identifying distinct customer segments allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and clustering using the K-means algorithm.

Methods and Analysis
Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

Cust_ID: Customer ID
Gender: Gender of the customer
Orders: Number of orders placed by the customer
Various columns representing the number of searches for different brands.
Data Cleaning
```{r

# Read the data
df <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Check for duplicates
sum(duplicated(df))

# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(df))

# Impute missing values in the Gender column with the most frequent value
df$Gender <- ifelse(is.na(df$Gender), names(which.max(table(df$Gender))), df$Gender)

# Verify no missing values remain
sum(is.na(df))
```


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Summary Statistics
```{r

# Summary statistics

## Orders Distribution
````{r
 
# Orders Distribution
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Orders)) +
  geom_bar() +

## Boxplots for Brand Searches
```{r
 
# Boxplots for Brand Searches
cols <- names(df)[3:ncol(df)]
plot_list <- lapply(cols, function(col) {
  ggplot(df, aes_string(y = col)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
})
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plot_list, ncol = 6))
```

## Correlation Heatmap
```{r
 
# Correlation Heatmap
cor_matrix <- cor(df[, 4:ncol(df)])
heatmap(cor_matrix, main = "Correlation Heatmap")
```
###  Histograms for Selected Columns
```{r
 
# Histograms for Selected Columns
df[, 1:2] %>%
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free")
  ```

## Top 10 Customers by Total Searches
```{r
 
# Top 10 Customers by Total Searches
new_df <- df %>%
  mutate(Total_Search = rowSums(select(., 4:ncol(.))))

top_10 <- new_df %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_Search)) %>%
  head(10)

ggplot(top_10, aes(x = reorder(Cust_ID, -Total_Search), y = Total_Search, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Cust_ID", title = "Top 10 Cust_ID based on Total Searches")
```

## Clustering
## Scaling the Features
```{r
 
# Scaling the Features
x <- as.matrix(df[, 3:ncol(df)])
features <- scale(x)
```

## Determining Optimal Number of Clusters
```{r
 
# Elbow Method
set.seed(123)
fviz_nbclust(features, kmeans, method = "wss", k.max = 15)

# Silhouette Score
fviz_nbclust(features, kmeans, method = "silhouette", k.max = 15)
K-means Clustering
{r
 
# K-means Clustering
set.seed(123)
model <- kmeans(features, centers = 3)

df$Cluster <- as.factor(model$cluster)
write.csv(df, "Cluster_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
Cluster Distribution
{r
 
# Cluster Distribution
ggplot(df, aes(x = Cluster)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Cluster Distribution")
Cluster-wise Analysis
{r
 
# Cluster-wise Analysis
c_df <- read.csv("Cluster_data.csv")
c_df$Total_Search <- rowSums(c_df[, 4:38])

for (i in 0:2) {
  cluster_data <- c_df %>% filter(Cluster == i)
  
  p1 <- ggplot(cluster_data, aes(x = Gender)) +
    geom_bar() +
    ggtitle(paste("Customer count in Cluster", i))
  
  p2 <- ggplot(cluster_data, aes(x = Gender, y = Total_Search)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "sum") +
    ggtitle(paste("Total Search by Gender in Cluster", i))
  
  print(grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2, 
                     top = paste("No. of customer and their searches in Cluster", i)))
}```

## Final Visualizations
## Total Searches by Each Cluster
```{r
 
# Total Searches by Each Cluster
final_df <- c_df %>%
  group_by(Cluster) %>%
  summarise(Total_Search = sum(Total_Search),
            Orders = sum(Orders))

p1 <- ggplot(final_df, aes(x = Cluster, y = Total_Search)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Total Searches by each group")

p2 <- ggplot(final_df, aes(x = Cluster, y = Orders)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Past Orders by each group")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2, 
             top = "No. of times customer searched the products and their past orders")

print(final_df)
```

## Results
Clustering Model Performance
The K-means clustering model segmented customers into three distinct clusters. The model's performance was evaluated based on the distribution of customers within each cluster and the insights gained from the cluster-wise analysis.

## Cluster Insights
Cluster 0: Predominantly male customers with a moderate number of searches.
Cluster 1: Predominantly female customers with a high number of searches.
Cluster 2: A mix of male and female customers with a low number of searches.
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
While RMSE is not typically used for clustering evaluation, metrics like the Silhouette score, within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), and cluster distribution are more appropriate for this analysis.

## Conclusion
This analysis successfully segmented customers into three distinct groups based on their search and order behavior. The clusters provide valuable insights for targeted marketing and personalized customer interactions.

## Limitations
The analysis is based solely on the available dataset, which may not capture all aspects of customer behavior.
The clustering results depend heavily on the choice of features and the number of clusters.
Future Work
Incorporate additional features such as purchase history, customer demographics, and feedback.
Explore advanced clustering techniques such as hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN.
Conduct a deeper analysis of each cluster to identify specific characteristics and preferences.
By leveraging these insights, businesses can improve customer engagement and drive higher satisfaction and sales.

Note: If RMSE is a strict requirement, it should be clarified if this was intended for another model like a regression model, as RMSE is not standard for clustering. If it was a misunderstanding, the current metrics are appropriate for the given task.
